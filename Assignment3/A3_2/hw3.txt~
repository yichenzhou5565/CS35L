Q1:
The patch improves "ls"'s performance.
Before appending the patch, -a and -A
does not do the right thing in regard
of overriding.
Now it is having the correct bahavior as
we expect.

Q2:
If the company adopts this patch,
it should watch out for its previous
codes which involves -a and -A. This
is because now the sccript will have a
different behavior and will cause
products to crash due to incapability.


Q3:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.16/lib/python2.7/random.py",
       line 277, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Q4:
It gives an erroe message regarding syntax
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
    	   	      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
My guess for the reason is that Python updated
its error handling method


Q5:
It can still run normally.
The reason could be that no specific
packages ot modules or syntax to
Python3 is used which is not
incampatible with Python2..
For instance,
I used optparse, not
argparse
