1.
As stated in the spec, if the other team really had been 
observing all the bytes going across the the network in 
the lab session, my resulting network will still be SECURE.

WHY:
Because we are using an asymmetric encryption here. First
consider the process of encryption. The intended text message
would be encoded using the recipient's public key, then the
encrypted message will be sent to the recipient. Note that
in the process of decyption, the recipient will use his/her
private key to decode the text and read the message. Only the
local are aware of the content of private key. For a third 
team attempting to break in, they have no idea of what the 
private key is and therefore cannot read the message successfully.

(1)
The answer would not change (i.e., still SECURE). The third team
observing all keystrokes on keyboard means they have access to
the passphrase. However, they still do not have access to the 
private key.

(2)
The answer would change (i.e., NOT SECURE). Once the third party
has physical control, they can get the private and public key
easily, so the network would be completely "open" to them from
now on. Aka, no longer secure.

2.
Problem with gpg --verify:
This command does not really verify who make all those stuff.
Instead, this command only aims to verify if using the public
key, whether the original file and the decrypted file are the
same. The thrid party can get the key and easily create a file
on their own.

Proposed solution:
We might fix this problem using a kind of certificate to make
sure the indentity is verified for the author.

Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Yichen Zhou

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
